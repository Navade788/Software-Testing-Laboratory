### REGISTER NUMBER : 212224230180

### AIM:  
To write python programs for do…while, while, for, switch and if…else and test with possible test 
Cases 

### Algorithm:
1. Start the program.
2. Create separate files for each given program.
3. Write simple program for each construct.
4.  the program with possible test cases.
5. Stop the program.
### Program:
