### AIM: 

Write a python program for Binary Search and inspect for failures. 

### Algorithm:

1. Start the program.
2. Get the list from the user
3. Get the element to be searched
4. Compare the mid element with the key, if same return the index
5. If key is greater, search it in the right side, else search it in the left side.
6. If not found return

### Program:

![stl05inp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/00da57c0-f886-416e-944c-f3a5637f6ef6)


### Output:

![stl05op](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd16be78-91f4-4e36-a002-544b8cfee31f)


### Result:

Thus, the python program of binary search is implemented and the output is verified
successfully.
